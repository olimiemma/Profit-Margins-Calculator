# The AI aspect.
Since I care more about the AI aspect, It's only fair I tell you about how I did this. Nothing complicated. I used Bard for the Python code-easy. LiterallyAnything for the HTML, there's a bard edition that edited and added some aspects to that HTML. There's also a GPT edition of the HTML, but I personally prefer the LiteralyAnything version
